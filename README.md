## GPUCloudSim: an extension of CloudSim for modeling and simulation of GPUs in cloud data centers

In order to satisfy graphical and computational requirements of end-users, today cloud providers offer GPU-enabled services. To ease-up conducting experimental studies on GPU-enabled cloud computing environments, we provide an extension to [CloudSim](http://cloudbus.org/cloudsim/) simulator. Our extension includes models and provisioning and scheduling policies to enable the modeling and simulation of GPUs in data centers.
